### Detailed Description of the Two-Sided Market Model

#### Overview
The Two-Sided Market Model is an interactive simulation tool designed for entrepreneurs and business leaders to evaluate and understand the dynamics of a two-sided marketplace. In such a marketplace, there are two distinct groups: consumers and providers. The tool helps users visualize how these groups grow and interact over time, considering various factors like attrition rates, growth rates, and market saturation points.

#### Uses of the Model
This model is valuable for:
- **Evaluating Market Dynamics**: Understanding how different factors influence the growth and retention of users on both sides of the market.
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Assisting in making informed decisions about marketing strategies, customer acquisition, and provider engagement.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Simulating various scenarios to see potential outcomes based on changes in market conditions or business strategies.

#### Potential Questions the Model Can Answer
- How does changing the consumer growth rate impact the number of users over time?
- What is the effect of a high provider attrition rate on the overall platform growth?
- At what point does adding more providers no longer significantly increase consumer attraction?
- How sensitive are consumers to changes in the availability of products or services?
- What is the optimal balance between consumer and provider growth to sustain the platform?

#### Description of Each Input Question

1. **Consumer Attrition Rate**:
   - *Question*: What percentage of your customers leave the platform each day?
   - *Explanation*: This measures the rate at which consumers stop using your platform. A higher rate indicates more customers leaving, which can be due to dissatisfaction or better alternatives.

2. **Consumer Growth Rate**:
   - *Question*: What percentage growth in new customers do you experience each day?
   - *Explanation*: This represents the daily rate at which new consumers join the platform. A higher rate indicates strong customer acquisition, potentially driven by effective marketing or platform attractiveness.

3. **Provider Attrition Rate**:
   - *Question*: What percentage of your providers leave the platform each day?
   - *Explanation*: Similar to consumer attrition, this rate indicates how many providers stop offering their services on the platform. This can affect the availability of products or services.

4. **Provider Growth Rate**:
   - *Question*: What percentage growth in new providers do you experience each day?
   - *Explanation*: This shows how quickly new providers are joining the platform, expanding the range of offerings and attracting more consumers.

5. **Consumer Affinity**:
   - *Question*: How attractive do you believe your platform is to new consumers when the platform is fully developed? (1-10)
   - *Explanation*: This subjective measure reflects how appealing the platform is to potential consumers. A higher value indicates a more attractive platform, likely leading to higher growth rates.

6. **Provider Affinity**:
   - *Question*: How attractive do you believe your platform is to providers when there is a large consumer base? (1-10)
   - *Explanation*: This indicates how attractive the platform is to providers, based on the size of the consumer base. A higher value suggests that providers find significant value in joining the platform.

7. **Consumer Growth Sensitivity**:
   - *Question*: How sensitive are consumers to changes in the number of available products or services? (1-5)
   - *Explanation*: This measures how changes in the number of providers (and hence the variety of services/products) affect consumer growth. A higher value means consumers are more responsive to such changes.

8. **Provider Growth Sensitivity**:
   - *Question*: How sensitive are providers to changes in the consumer base size? (1-5)
   - *Explanation*: This reflects how responsive providers are to changes in the size of the consumer base. A higher value indicates that providers are more likely to join or stay on the platform as the consumer base grows.

9. **Consumer Saturation**:
   - *Question*: At what size do you expect the attractiveness to new consumers to stop increasing significantly? (1-5)
   - *Explanation*: This defines the point at which additional providers no longer significantly boost the platform's attractiveness to new consumers. A lower value means the market saturates quickly.

10. **Provider Saturation**:
    - *Question*: At what size do you expect the attractiveness to new providers to stop increasing significantly? (1-5)
    - *Explanation*: This indicates when the consumer base size no longer significantly enhances the platform's attractiveness to new providers.

11. **Initial Consumers**:
    - *Question*: How many consumers are currently using your platform?
    - *Explanation*: The starting number of consumers, which sets the initial condition for the simulation.

12. **Initial Providers**:
    - *Question*: How many providers are currently providing products or services on your platform?
    - *Explanation*: The initial number of providers, essential for understanding the current state of the marketplace.

13. **Simulation Duration**:
    - *Question*: How long do you want the simulation to run (in days)?
    - *Explanation*: The period over which the simulation will run, allowing users to observe trends and changes over time.
